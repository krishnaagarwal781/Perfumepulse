          <ul>
            <li>
              Subscriptions; Automatic Renewal; Changes. Please see our Site for
              a current description of the subscriptions we offer through the
              Services (“Subscriptions”), how to place an order for a
              Subscription and our policies with respect to changing or
              cancelling a Subscription. Note that Subscriptions are
              automatically renewed and will continue for renewal periods of the
              same duration as the Subscription term originally selected at the
              then-current price (or for the term and price as subsequently
              modified by you), unless you have cancelled such Subscription. You
              acknowledge that Subscriptions have an initial and recurring
              payment feature and you accept responsibility for all recurring
              charges prior to cancellation. For a given Subscription, you can
              change your preferences in your Account, where you can skip or
              cancel such Subscription. Any changes must be made at least five
              (5) days before your next ship date. Our Site will let you know if
              you can still modify the next shipment before it ships.
            </li>
            <li>
              One-Time Purchases. Please see our Site for a current description
              of the products you can purchase through the Services
              (“Purchases”). If you choose to make a Purchase, such Purchase
              will be shipped to you with the next shipment of your
              Subscription.
            </li>
            <li>
              Order Processing. All orders are subject to acceptance by us. We
              may choose not to accept your order for any reason without
              liability to you, and SCO reserves the right to refuse or cancel
              any order or transaction at any time, in its sole discretion. For
              example, we may choose to not process or to cancel your order when
              a product is out of stock or has been mispriced or if we suspect
              the request is fraudulent. If we decide not to process your order
              or if we cancel all or a portion of your order, SCO will either
              not charge you for the applicable item(s) or provide you with a
              refund for the applicable item(s).
            </li>
            <li>
              Risk of Loss. The risk of loss and title for all products you
              order passes to you upon our delivery to the carrier (such as
              Pgeon, FedEx, GDex, Pos Malaysia or PosLaju).
            </li>
            <li>
              Returns and Exchanges. Unfortunately, due to the nature of our
              product, we cannot accept returns or exchanges. We understand that
              relationships don’t always work out and we hope you’ll come back
              to try our new products.
            </li>
            <li>
              Unfortunately due to the nature of the product, refunds are not
              conducted.
            </li>
            <li>
              In order to submit an order through the Services, you must use a
              valid credit card or other payment method accepted by the Services
              (which may change from time to time in SCO’s sole discretion)
              (your “Payment Method”), with full authority to use it. SCO
              reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to take steps to
              verify your identity and/or eligibility to process your order.
              Please note that any payment terms presented to you in the process
              of placing an order through the Services are deemed part of this
              Agreement. We use a third-party payment processor, Stripe
              Singapore (www.stripe.com) (the “Payment Processor”) to allow you
              to pay for orders through the Services. The processing of payments
              will be subject to the terms, conditions and privacy policies of
              the Payment Processor in addition to this Agreement. As it will be
              an oversea transaction, you may be subjected to an oversea
              transaction fee incurred by your respective bank. We are not
              responsible for error by the Payment Processor. By choosing to
              purchase products through the Services, you agree to pay us,
              through the Payment Processor, all charges at the prices then in
              effect for your purchase in accordance with your Payment Method
              and you authorize us, through the Payment Processor, to charge
              your Payment Method. Such charges for your purchase may include
              shipping fees and state and local sales tax, the amount of which
              varies due to factors including the type of item purchased and the
              shipping destination. You agree to make payment using that
              selected Payment Method. We reserve the right to correct any
              errors or mistakes that it makes even if it has already requested
              or received payment. For subscriptions, we may submit periodic
              charges (e.g. monthly) without further authorisation from you,
              until you have priovided prior notice (receipt of which is
              confirmed by us) that you have terminated this authorisation or
              wish to change your payment method. Such notice will not affect
              charges submitted before we reasonably could act. To terminate
              your authorisation or change your payment method, please login to
              your account and select "Manage your Account".
            </li>
            <li>
              Payment Method. The terms of your payment will be based on your
              Payment Method and may be determined by agreements between you and
              the financial institution, credit card issuer or other provider of
              your chosen Payment Method. If we, through the Payment Processor,
              do not receive payment from you, you agree to pay all amounts due
              on your applicable order upon demand.
            </li>
            <li>
              Current Information Required. YOU MUST PROVIDE CURRENT, COMPLETE
              AND ACCURATE INFORMATION FOR YOUR PAYMENT METHOD. YOU MUST
              PROMPTLY UPDATE ALL INFORMATION TO KEEP YOUR PAYMENT METHOD
              CURRENT, COMPLETE AND ACCURATE (SUCH AS A CHANGE IN BILLING
              ADDRESS, CREDIT CARD NUMBER, OR CREDIT CARD EXPIRATION DATE), AND
              YOU MUST PROMPTLY NOTIFY US OR OUR PAYMENT PROCESSOR IF YOUR
              PAYMENT METHOD IS CANCELLED (E.G., FOR LOSS OR THEFT) OR IF YOU
              BECOME AWARE OF A POTENTIAL BREACH OF SECURITY, SUCH AS THE
              UNAUTHORIZED DISCLOSURE OR USE OF YOUR USER NAME OR PASSWORD.
              CHANGES TO SUCH INFORMATION CAN BE MADE THROUGH YOUR ACCOUNT. IF
              YOU FAIL TO PROVIDE ANY OF THE FOREGOING INFORMATION, YOU AGREE
              THAT WE MAY CONTINUE CHARGING YOU FOR YOUR SUBSCRIPTION UNLESS YOU
              HAVE TERMINATED YOUR SUBSCRIPTION THROUGH THE SERVICES.
            </li>
            <li>
              Change in Amount Authorized. If the amount to be charged to your
              Payment Method varies from the amount you pre-authorized (other
              than due to the imposition or change in the amount of state sales
              taxes), you have the right to receive, and we shall provide,
              notice of the amount to be charged and the date of the charge
              before the scheduled date of the transaction. Any agreement you
              have with your payment provider will govern your use of your
              Payment Method. You agree that we may accumulate charges incurred
              and submit them as one or more aggregate charges during or at the
              end of each billing cycle.
            </li>
            <li>
              Reaffirmation of Authorization. Your non-termination of a
              Subscription reaffirms that we are authorized to charge your
              Payment Method for that Subscription. We may submit those charges
              for payment and you will be responsible for such charges. This
              does not waive our right to seek payment directly from you. Your
              charges may be payable in advance, in arrears, per usage, or as
              otherwise described when you initially selected to order the
              Subscription.
            </li>
            <li>
              Promotional Credits. From time to time, SCO may choose to issue a
              certain number of credits (“Promotional Credits”) to your Account
              (the “Program”). In addition to any specific rules and
              descriptions for each issuance of Promotional Credits, which are
              incorporated herein, the following terms apply. IF YOU DO NOT
              AGREE TO THESE TERMS, YOU SHOULD NOT ACCEPT PROMOTIONAL CREDITS
              THROUGH THE SITE.
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Promotional Credits, the number of Promotional Credits, and
                  the redemption value of Promotional Credits and any
                  restrictions on the use of Promotional Credits, are issued at
                  SCO’s sole discretion to the fullest extent of the law. Any
                  Promotional Credits issued shall be automatically redeemed at
                  checkout on your next shipment(s) through the Services, until
                  the Promotional Credits are fully redeemed. You acknowledge
                  that even if Promotional Credits are redeemed on a shipment,
                  you may still need to pay for expedited shipping if you choose
                  expedited shipping for such shipment and you do not have
                  enough Promotional Credits to cover the full cost. Any
                  remaining balance on the purchase amount for a given shipment
                  after Promotional Credits are fully redeemed is your sole
                  responsibility. You cannot choose when (or when not) to redeem
                  any Promotional Credits in your Account.
                </li>
                <li>
                  To the fullest extent of the law, Promotional Credits
                  automatically expire and are forfeited at the date that is
                  three (3) years after the date such Promotional Credits are
                  issued AND THERE IS NO DORMANCY FEE. Promotional Credits are
                  only valid for redemption on the Services and are void where
                  prohibited or restricted by law. Promotional Credits are
                  promotional in nature and are not legal tender. Promotional
                  Credits are non-transferable, non-exchangeable, have no value
                  and cannot be used for cash back or sold. SCO reserves the
                  right, in its sole discretion at any time, to void any
                  Promotional Credits, or to cancel, suspend, terminate or
                  modify any aspect of the Program, with or without notice to
                  you. SCO also reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to
                  terminate your participation in the Program at any time, with
                  or without cause, with or without notice, effective
                  immediately, including without limitation if SCO deems or
                  suspects any violation of these terms and conditions,
                  cheating, fraud or tampering with the operation of Program.
                </li>
                <li>
                  By participating in the Program, you agree to release and hold
                  harmless SCO, and its affiliates, suppliers, partners, parent
                  companies, subsidiaries, employees, contractors, directors,
                  officers, agents, and representatives, from any and all
                  economic liabilities, claims, damages, loss, harm, costs or
                  expenses, including without limitation property damage, that
                  arise from or relate to in any way the Program and/or use or
                  misuse of Promotional Credits. THIS SUB-SECTION 8.k(iii)
                  APPLIES ONLY TO ECONOMIC DAMAGES AND DOES NOT APPLY TO CLAIMS
                  OF FRAUD OR PERSONAL INJURY.

            </li>
            <li>
              Other Credits. From time to time, SCO may choose to issue a
              certain number of non-promotional credits (“Other Credits”) to
              your Account. Other Credits include, without limitation, credit
              issued to you for any returns (that we may reject or accept in our
              sole direction and that we generally do not accept) or for credit
              issued to you for a minor error with our third-party vendors or
              carriers. In addition to any specific description of the issuance
              of Other Credits, which are incorporated herein, the following
              terms apply. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS, YOU SHOULD NOT
              ACCEPT OTHER CREDITS THROUGH THE SITE.
            </li>
            <li>
              Other Credits, the number of Other Credits, and the redemption
              value of Other Credits, and any restrictions on the use of Other
              Credits are issued at SCO’s sole discretion to the fullest extent
              of the law. Any Other Credits issued shall be automatically
              redeemed at checkout on your next shipment(s) through the
              Services, until the Other Credits are fully redeemed. You
              acknowledge that even if Other Credits are redeemed on a shipment,
              you may still need to pay for expedited shipping if you choose
              expedited shipping for such shipment and you do not have enough
              Other Credits to cover the full cost. Any remaining balance on the
              purchase amount for a given shipment after Other Credits are fully
              redeemed is your sole responsibility. You cannot choose when (or
              when not) to redeem any Other Credits in your Account.
            </li>
            <li>
              THERE IS NO DORMANCY FEE. Other Credits are only valid for
              redemption on the Services and are void where prohibited or
              restricted by law. To the fullest extent of the law, Other Credits
              cannot be used for cash back or sold.

              Entire Agreement. These Terms of Service are the entire agreement
              between you and us with respect to the Services, including use of
              the Site, and supersede all prior or contemporaneous

            <li>
              If any provision of these Terms of Service is found to be
              unenforceable or invalid, that provision will be limited or
              eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that these Terms of
              Service will otherwise remain in full force and effect and
              enforceable. The failure of either party to exercise in any

              Force Majeure. We shall not be liable for any failure to perform
              our obligations hereunder where such failure results from any
              cause beyond our reasonable control, including, without
              limitation, mechanical, electronic or communications failure or
              degradation.

              of compliance in any particular instance does not mean that we
              will waive compliance in the future. In order for any waiver of
              compliance with these Terms of Service to be binding, we must
              provide you with written notice of such waiver through one of our
              authorized representatives.
